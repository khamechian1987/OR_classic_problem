OR Classic Problems
Welcome to the OR Classic Problems repository! This repository contains implementations of various classic Operations Research (OR) problems using different optimization techniques. Each problem is well-documented and includes examples to help you understand and solve similar problems.
Introduction
Operations Research is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. This repository contains a collection of classic OR problems such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Facility Location Problem, Machine Scheduling, and Network Problems. The goal is to provide clear and efficient implementations to solve these problems.

Problems Included
1. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
The VRP involves finding the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to various locations. The objective is to minimize the total route cost while satisfying constraints like vehicle capacity and delivery windows.

2. Facility Location Problem
This problem focuses on determining the most strategic locations for facilities to minimize transportation costs and meet customer demand. It's crucial in logistics, supply chain management, and urban planning.

3. Machine Scheduling
Machine scheduling problems aim to allocate jobs to machines in a way that optimizes a given objective, such as minimizing total completion time, tardiness, or maximizing machine utilization.

4. Network Problems
Network problems involve optimizing the flow of goods or information through a network to achieve objectives like minimizing transportation costs or maximizing throughput.
